# Camouflaged Object Detection with YOLOv5

## Overview

This project aims to detect camouflaged objects using the COD10K dataset and the YOLOv5 model. The objective is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of identifying objects that blend into their surroundings, a challenging task in computer vision.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset:** COD10K
- **Model:** YOLOv5
- **Publication:** Shortlisted for Springer publication
